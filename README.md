# Cyber-tool
Final Project for OOP 

Introduction:

In the modern era of technology, keeping digital information safe has become incredibly important for both people and companies all over the world. With the rise of cyber dangers like hacking, phishing, and viruses, it's crucial to make sure that software systems are secure and dependable. BY-LOT's project is looking into different ways to improve software security by studying how well different methods of raising awareness and taking action actually work.

Statement of Problem:

The increasing frequency and sophistication of cyber threats pose significant risks to the integrity and functionality of software systems. Despite advancements in security technologies, many organizations struggle to mitigate these risks effectively. The lack of robust security practices, such as employee training programs, security audits, threat modeling, and vulnerability management, leaves software systems vulnerable to exploitation and compromise.

Objectives:

The primary objective of BY-LOT's project is to explore the impact of different security practices on enhancing the overall security posture of software systems. Specifically, the project aims to:

1. Assess the effectiveness of employee training programs in raising awareness and promoting security best practices among staff members.
2. Evaluate the role of security audits and testing in identifying vulnerabilities and weaknesses within software systems.
3. Investigate the utility of threat modeling as a proactive measure for anticipating and mitigating potential security threats.
4. Examine the effectiveness of vulnerability management strategies in addressing and remedying security vulnerabilities promptly.
5. Explore other relevant security measures and their contributions to building robust software security.

Features:

1. IP Configuration: Allows users to retrieve and view network configuration details using the `ipconfig` command.

2. Cybercrime Legislation: Provides information about the Philippine Republic Act No. 10175 or the "Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012" to educate users about relevant legislation.

3. Brute Force Attack: Simulates a brute force attack scenario, where users can input a password to see how such attacks work and understand their implications.

4. Port Scanner: Enables users to scan ports on a target IP address to identify open and closed ports, aiding in network reconnaissance.

5. Key Logger: Demonstrates the concept of a key logger, allowing users to see how keystrokes can be captured, emphasizing the importance of protecting against such threats.

6. File Server: Initiates a simple file server that allows users to share files over a network, promoting collaboration and data sharing.

These features collectively contribute to a versatile and educational tool for networking and cybersecurity exploration.

Results:

Through comprehensive research and empirical analysis, BY-LOT's project intends to generate insights into the effectiveness of various security practices in  software security. The project aims to provide evidence-based recommendations for organizations seeking to enhance their security posture and mitigate the risks posed by cyber threats.

Conclusion:

In conclusion, BY-LOT's project represents a significant endeavor to address the pressing need for robust software security in today's digital landscape. By investigating the effectiveness of different security practices, the project aims to empower organizations with the knowledge and tools necessary to safeguard their software systems against evolving cyber threats.

Future Directions:

Future research endeavors could focus on longitudinal studies to assess the long-term effectiveness of security measures and explore emerging technologies and methodologies for enhancing software security in response to evolving cyber threats. Additionally, collaborations with industry partners could facilitate the implementation and validation of security best practices in real-world settings.
